# News Research Tool

The News Research Tool is a web-based application designed to assist users in extracting and analyzing content from online news articles. By combining the capabilities of LangChain and OpenAI's language models, the tool enables interactive querying of the fetched articles. It retrieves article data using URL loaders, processes and embeds the content into vector space using OpenAI Embeddings, and stores it efficiently with FAISS for similarity-based search and retrieval.

The system provides a natural language interface for users to ask questions related to the loaded articles. It returns answers generated by a language model alongside references to the original content sources. The application is ideal for researchers, students, or journalists who need to gather and understand information from multiple news articles in a streamlined, intelligent, and interactive manner.
